# salient.io
salient.io is a natural language processing and sentiment analysis engine. Salient.io is not a social analytics engine, it doesn't do brand recognition or custom brand analysis, salient.io will not visualize your Facebook dashboard and it will not tell you how to trade on the stock market. salient.io is about doing one thing and doing it really well - providing the best salience and natural language processing / text analytics api for a small monthly fee.

### Goals
The goal of the project is to acquire several thousand users as a use case for leveraging various text analysis functions that are core to the system. Core functional goals of salient.io include the following:

* Provide Deep Semantic Analysis
* Sentiment Analysis
* Question and Feedback Grouping Insight
* Subjectivity Analysis
* Irrelevance Scoring
* Linear Regression and Bayesian Network Modeling
* Provide a request credits based system for all api calls
* Integrate Stripe for automated billing for tiered request call limits and pricing
* Support 3 languages at start-up possibly including:
  * English
  * Spanish
  * Mandarin Chinese
* Be extremely fast (high concurrency, highly responsive)
* Quantitative analysis for all aspects of expenses
* Quality Customer Support and A/B Testing
* Fault-tolerant and most importantlyâ€¦
* Automation everywhere

These are the core business goals of salient.io and given a modest goal of reaching 1000 users all paying small monthly fees, salient.io should be a very maintainable project from the start.

### Technology Considerations
There are many aspects of developing technologies that should lead to the proper evaluation of using one set of tools over another. There should be careful consideration to the priorities of the core business that can attribute to the most effective technologies that can solve those immediate needs. Considerations need to be made for the following support infrastructure:

* Monitoring and Scale Automation
* Highly Concurrent Requests, High Performance
* Natural Language Processing Libraries
* Math Libraries
* Machine Learning
* Fault Tolerant, High Write Load Database Storage
* Productivity to Minimal Viable Product
* Low Memory Footprint
* Secure Infrastructure
* Reusability
* Zero-license dependencies (e.g. open source)

### Timeline Goals
Since there isn't much time available to build out a complete product (e.g. full-time schedule), there should be some basic baseline guidelines for building this out. This should take into consideration the percentage of time necessary and priorities devoted to scaling this properly.

* Goal: 1000 users in 120 days
* Requirements: Framework, API, Monitoring, Business, Billing, Website
* Time allowed per week: 14 hrs/week 

### Support and Dedication
I would like to thank my best friend and wife-to-be for supporting me in this endeavor. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be where I today and be able to achieve such aspiring and ambitious intentions. You are my sunshine :)

## Text Processing and Tokenization

Text processing needs to be very performant and take careful consideration to the many nuances that come with online media. There are different types of tokenization processes that use various types of boundary detection using maximum entropy clauses to other types of regular expression methods. Since regular expressions will likely be the primary method of processing text, the following performance considerations and aspects are noted:

* Whitespace
* URLS
* Images (primarily from html media)
* Hashtags
* Cashtags
* Username Mentions
* Abbreviations
* Emoticons
* Quotations
* Hyphenations
* Words
* Sentence Punctuation
* Possessive Punctuation
* Contractions
* Emoji
* Ellipsis
* Misc. Punctuation
* Numbers
* Times
* Dates
